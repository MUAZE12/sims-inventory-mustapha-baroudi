## üîß Business Logic Implementation

### Inventory Optimization
```python
# EOQ Calculation
eoq = sqrt((2 * annual_demand * ordering_cost) / holding_cost_per_unit)

# Reorder Point
reorder_point = (average_daily_demand * lead_time) + safety_stock

# ABC Classification
# Class A: 80% of revenue (top 20% of products)
# Class B: 15% of revenue (next 30% of products)  
# Class C: 5% of revenue (remaining 50% of products)
```
